## Development Setup
To set up the project for local development:

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already forked and cloned):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-name/vitap-vtop-client.git
    cd vitap-vtop-client  # Fixed directory name to match repository
    ```

2. **Set up Python virtual environment** (optional):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):

    This project uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging.

    ```bash
    # Install Poetry using the official installer
    # For Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

    # For Windows(Powershell)
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    
    # Verify installation
    poetry --version
    
    # Configure Poetry to create virtual environments in the project directory(optional)
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```

For other ways of installation visit : [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

**Important Notes:**
- The `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true` ensures Poetry creates its virtual environment in the project directory (under `.venv/`), keeping everything self-contained.
- If you want to use the virtual environment you created manually (step 2), run `poetry install` after activating it.
    
## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style Guide
-   Follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
-   Use a linter like Flake8 or Pylint to check your code.
-   Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
-   Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.
-   Use type hints where appropriate.

### Commit Messages
-   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
-   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
-   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
-   Reference issues and PRs liberally.
-   Consider using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for more structured commit messages, e.g.:
    -   `feat: add new endpoint for course registration`
    -   `fix: resolve issue with captcha parsing`
    -   `docs: update README with new setup instructions`
    -   `refactor: improve performance of attendance fetching`
    -   `test: add unit tests for profile parser`

## Testing
-   Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
-   Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
-   Tests are typically located in a `tests/` directory (though not explicitly shown in the provided project structure, it's a best practice).
-   Use a testing framework like `pytest` or Python's built-in `unittest`.

## Documentation
-   Keep the [`README.md`](/README.md), [`DOCS.md`](/DOCS.md) and other documentation files up-to-date with your changes.
-   If you add new features or change existing ones, update the relevant sections of the documentation.
-   For API changes, ensure the endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and examples are accurate.
